        <h4>The Rules</h4>
        <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
            <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
            <li>
                    If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
